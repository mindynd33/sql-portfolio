Here is a SQL query with a common table expression.

WITH top_cust_cte (customer_id, first_name, last_name, country, city) AS
(SELECT A. customer_id,
	   A. first_name,
	   A. last_name,
	   D. country,
	   C. city,
	   SUM (E. amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM customer A
	INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
	INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
	INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
	INNER JOIN payment E on A. customer_id = E. customer_id
GROUP BY A. customer_id, first_name, last_name, country, city) 
SELECT customer_id, 
	   AVG (total_amount_paid) AS average_payment
FROM top_cust_cte
WHERE city IN ('Aurora', 
			   'Acua',
			   'Citrus Heights', 
			   'Iwaki', 
			   'Ambattur', 
			   'Shanwei',
			   'So Leopoldo'

GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY average_payment DESC
LIMIT 5
